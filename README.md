Sentiment Analysis Model for classifying Restautrant Reviews

# Problem Statement
Develop a Sentiment Analysis Model to classify restaurant reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories. The objective is to analyze customer feedback and provide actionable insights for restaurant owners. The dataset will consist of textual reviews from various platforms, which will be preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information. The model will employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stop-word removal. Various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and deep learning approaches like LSTM or BERT, will be explored. Performance will be evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The final model aims to accurately capture the sentiment expressed in the reviews, aiding restaurants in improving customer satisfaction and service quality. This system will provide a user-friendly interface for real-time sentiment analysis, allowing restaurant managers to respond promptly to customer feedback.
